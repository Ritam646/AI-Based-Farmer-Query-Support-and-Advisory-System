ReferencesDiseases- Oomycete- Fungal- ViralPests- Insects- NematodesSee questions about CardamomDescriptionCardamom Elletaria cardamomum is an herbaceous perennial in the family Zingiberaceae grown for its fruits which are used as a spice Cardamom is a clumping plant with between 10 and 20 leafy shoots arising from the rhizome The shoots are actually pseudostems composed of overlapping leaf sheaths There are several additional flowering shoots The leaves are lanceolate and dark green in color The plant produces flowers on a long drooping pannicle and a capsule-like fruit which is triangular in cross section and initially pale green or yellow in color but dries to brown The fruit contains 1520 small aromatic seeds Cardamom can reach a height of 5 m 164 ft and has an economic lifespan of 10-15 years Cardamom may also be referred to as green cardamom black cardamom brown cardamom red cardamom or white cardamom and originates from southern India and Sri LankaUsesThe cardamom fruit or seeds are used dried as a culinary spice The seeds are used whole or ground Cardamom may also be used as a flavoring in drinks baked goods and confectionPropagationBasic requirements Cardamom originates from mountainous forests and can be grown in a variety of soils ranging from forest loam to quartz gravels It can be grown in the home garden in areas with tropical climates and elsewhere can be grown as a container plant and moved indoors when the temperature drops in the Fall The optimum annual mean temperature for the growth of the plant is 22C 716F and the plant will not grow below 17C 626F As a consequence of their forest origins cardamom plants thrive in shaded areas with indirect sunlight Propagation Cardamom seeds can be collected from the mature capsules pods by gently pressing the capsules until they pop open The seeds should be left to dry for a couple of days before planting in a container or outdoors in a prepared bed For large scale production they are commonly sown in nursery beds and transplanted to the field when they are 12 years old Propagation from rhizomes is achieved by dividing the rhizome of plants that have at least three shoots Plants are usually spaced 153 m 510 ft apart allowing a further 153 m 510 ft between rowsReferencesAnandaraj M  Sudharsham M R 2010 Cardomom ginger and turmeric In Verheye W H ed Soils Plant Growth and Crop Production
