a plant of the genus Musa family Musaceae which is cultivated primarily for food and secondarily for the production of fibre used in the textile industry are also cultivated for ornamental purposes Almost all the modern edible parthenocarpic bananas come from the two wild species  Musa acuminataMusa balbisiana The scientific names of bananas are Musa acuminata Musa balbisiana or hybrids of Musa acuminata and balbisiana depending on their genomic constitutionBananas are vigorously growing monocotyledonous herbaceous plantsThe banana is not a tree but a high herb that can attain up to 15 meters of height The cultivars vary greatly in plant an d fruit size plant morphology fruit quality and disease and insect resistance Most bananas have a sweet flavor when ripe exceptions to this are cooking bananas and plantains Plantains are hybrid bananas in which the male flowering axis is either degenerated lacking or possess relicts of male flowers Plantains are always cooked before consumption and are higher in starch than bananas The two groups of plantains French and Horn produce fewer fruit per plant than sweet bananas The groups differ in whether the male parts of the
