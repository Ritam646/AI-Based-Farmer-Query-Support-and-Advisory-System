cooking bananas and plantains Plantains are hybrid bananas in which the male flowering axis is either degenerated lacking or possess relicts of male flowers Plantains are always cooked before consumption and are higher in starch than bananas The two groups of plantains French and Horn produce fewer fruit per plant than sweet bananas The groups differ in whether the male parts of the inflorescence are present or absentVarietiesDessert Robusta Dwarf Cavendish Grand Naine Rasthali Vayal vazhai Poovan Nendran Red Banana Karpooravalli Co1 Matti Sannachenkadali Udayam and Neypoovan are

from diseases and nematodes Trim the roots and decayed portion of the corm cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from the corm and grade the suckers to size To avoid wilt disease in Rasthali Monthan Virupakshi and other wilt susceptible varieties infected portions of the corm may be pared and dipped for 5 minutes in 01 Emisan solution 1 g in 1 lit of water Pralinage is done with 40 g of Carbofuran 3 G granules per sucker Dip the corm in slurry solution containing 4 parts clay plus 5 parts water and sprinkle Carbofuran to control nematodes Alternatively dip the corm with 075 Monocrotophos shade dry for atleast 24 hours and plant Sow Sunhemp on 45th day incorporate it after about a monthThis operation reduces nematode build up Use tissue cultured banana plants with 5-6

a plant of the genus Musa family Musaceae which is cultivated primarily for food and secondarily for the production of fibre used in the textile industry are also cultivated for ornamental purposes Almost all the modern edible parthenocarpic bananas come from the two wild species  Musa acuminataMusa balbisiana The scientific names of bananas are Musa acuminata Musa balbisiana or hybrids of Musa acuminata and balbisiana depending on their genomic constitutionBananas are vigorously growing monocotyledonous herbaceous plantsThe banana is not a tree but a high herb that can attain up to 15 meters of height The cultivars vary greatly in plant an d fruit size plant morphology fruit quality and disease and insect resistance Most bananas have a sweet flavor when ripe exceptions to this are cooking bananas and plantains Plantains are hybrid bananas in which the male flowering axis is either degenerated lacking or possess relicts of male flowers Plantains are always cooked before consumption and are higher in starch than bananas The two groups of plantains French and Horn produce fewer fruit per plant than sweet bananas The groups differ in whether the male parts of the inflorescence are present or absentVarietiesDessert Robusta Dwarf Cavendish Grand Naine Rasthali Vayal vazhai Poovan Nendran Red Banana Karpooravalli Co1 Matti Sannachenkadali Udayam and Neypoovan are

from diseases and nematodes Trim the roots and decayed portion of the corm cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from the corm and grade the suckers to size To avoid wilt disease in Rasthali Monthan Virupakshi and other wilt susceptible varieties infected portions of the corm may be pared and dipped for 5 minutes in 01 Emisan solution 1 g in 1 lit of water Pralinage is done with 40 g of Carbofuran 3 G granules per sucker Dip the corm in slurry solution containing 4 parts clay plus 5 parts water and sprinkle Carbofuran to control nematodes Alternatively dip the corm with 075 Monocrotophos shade dry for atleast 24 hours and plant Sow Sunhemp on 45th day incorporate it after about a monthThis operation reduces nematode build up Use tissue cultured banana plants with 5-6
