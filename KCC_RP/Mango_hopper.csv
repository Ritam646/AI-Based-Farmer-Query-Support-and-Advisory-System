fertigation for 30 days for induction of stress before flowering season resume as soon as flowering commencesCanopy management: Remove root stock sprouts and low lying branches nearer to ground to facilitate easy cultural operations Remove overlapping intercrossing diseased dried and weak branches in old trees to get good sunlight and aeration  Carry out judicious pruning of the internal branches during August  September once in three years  Do not allow flowering upto three years by removing the inflorescences as and when they appear  Retain two healthy shoots by trimming away the weak shoots among the crowded terminal shoots during August-September annually Prune back 20 cm of annual growth of the terminals immediately after harvestTop working of senile orchards for rejuvenation: Use scions of choice varieties like Alphonso and Banganapalli for top working Behead the trees to be top worked portion during July- August leaving the main trunk at a convenient height and allow for new shoots to develop  Adopt cleft method of grafting or softwood grafting on the emerging shoots on the main stem from the cut end during September- OctoberGrowth regulators

fertigation for 30 days for induction of stress before flowering season resume as soon as flowering commencesCanopy management: Remove root stock sprouts and low lying branches nearer to ground to facilitate easy cultural operations Remove overlapping intercrossing diseased dried and weak branches in old trees to get good sunlight and aeration  Carry out judicious pruning of the internal branches during August  September once in three years  Do not allow flowering upto three years by removing the inflorescences as and when they appear  Retain two healthy shoots by trimming away the weak shoots among the crowded terminal shoots during August-September annually Prune back 20 cm of annual growth of the terminals immediately after harvestTop working of senile orchards for rejuvenation: Use scions of choice varieties like Alphonso and Banganapalli for top working Behead the trees to be top worked portion during July- August leaving the main trunk at a convenient height and allow for new shoots to develop  Adopt cleft method of grafting or softwood grafting on the emerging shoots on the main stem from the cut end during September- OctoberGrowth regulators          NAA  20 ppm is sprayed at flowering to increase the fruit retention  During February 05 Urea 5 glit or 1 Potassium Nitrate 10glit may be sprayed to induce flowering if trees do not flower by that time
